          Hello, my name is RaphaÃ«l Fernier, I am 18 years old and I am passionate about sports and NFT. I am a dynamic and curious person. I am currently in the first year of the Bachelor's programme of the IESEG, a post-bac business school. I hope to become an auto-entrepreneur and then the owner of my own company!

        <h2>IESEG School of Management</h2>
        <p>
          IESEG is a French post-bac business school. It brings together different programmes including the 5-year Grandes Ecoles programme that I am currently doing. In its teaching, IESEG offers courses ranging from maths to creativity, including internships and expatriations abroad. I am looking forward to the next 4 years and I am very happy with my choice of school!

        <h2 >Discord skills</h2>

         <p>Discord is a social network that brings together people with similar interests ranging from graphics to video games, NFTs, films etc. I've been using it for more than 5 years now and I've mastered the application very well. It gave me the opportunity to participate and create many projects on which I could be paid (creation of esports tournaments, moderation on servers, administration of an NFT project etc.).

        <h2>Non Fungible Token</h2>
         <p> NFTs are virtual works of art that are purchased with cryptocurrency. NFTs are mostly affiliated with different projects that give access to private events and parties for their holders. The NFT market is exploding at the moment, and a lot of stars and brands are investing or creating their own NFT project. That's why, since 4 months, I started investing in my first NFT!
